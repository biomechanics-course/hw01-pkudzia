B. The final test is actually a demonstration of the computational error. Notice that the error
decreases with step size only to a point. In a sentence or two, explain why.

There will always be computational error. Intially the error is reduced via the function but it stabalizes for this resason
(computational error). As to why it goes up and then down I am not fully sure. 
Maybe it is so small that its just error in itself ?
